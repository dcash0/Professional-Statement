# Professional-Statement

Strengths that I currently posess for an occupation in cybersecurity are a knack in attention to detail, ability to understand programming, and good problem solving skills.

Another reason I believe that cybersecurity would be a good place for my skills would be my values in ethics and being responsible for maintaining a company's integrity when it comes to asset management and overall confidentiality.

The most interesting parts about cybersecurity for me, ouside of just being able to use computers and programming languages to essentially block outside and inside threats, but also the amount of responsibility that comes with the position.
